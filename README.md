# Tilt Gradient App

A Flutter app that displays a dynamic gradient effect that responds to the device's tilt. The background gradient changes as you tilt the device, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gradient**: The app uses device tilt to adjust the gradient background, creating a fluid and interactive effect.
- **Sensor Integration**: Utilizes the `sensors_plus` package to access the device's accelerometer and gyroscope for tilt detection.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Android and iOS devices.

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK 3.0.0 or above
- A device with a tilt sensor (accelerometer/gyroscope)
